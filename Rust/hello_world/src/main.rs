/* Rust install instructions for PC:

1. Install rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs/
2. Run installer, the full visual studio thing doesn't matter much
3. Add rust-analyzer extension in Visual Studio
4. Using "cargo build", if there are issues, install Windows 11 SDK at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/
5. Good to go hopefully, use "cargo run" to run a Rust Project folder, in this case, "Hello, World!"
